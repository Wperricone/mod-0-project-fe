## Array Methods

1. .pop this method removes the last element of an array, which makes it one element shorter.
2. .shift functions much like pop, but instead of removing the last element, it removes the first element.
3. .push does the opposite of .pop, in that it adds one or more elements to the end of an array, and says the new length of the array.
4. .unshift does the opposite of shift, in that it adds one or more elements to the beginning of an array, and says the length of the new array.
