## Section 1 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?
- I feel pretty good about asking questions, but I find I am often too late to raise my hand, and someone beats me to it. Also I have found that if I have a question, someone else probably has the same one, so either they are going to ask it, or it is good I do, because someone else also needs the answer!

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
- The first type of data we learned about is called a string. It is used to combine a series of characters, including letters, numbers and symbols. It is always depicted between "" or ''.
- The second type of data we learned about was number. This is any number, whether it is positive, negative, or a decimal. Letters are not a part of this data type.
- The third type of data we learned about is boolean. This is used when the answer to something is either true or false, thus forcing the program to do one thing or another.

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?
- console.log("Hello world!");

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?
- Anything following // will be a comment and will not  be treated like code. Additionally, if you decide to turn a section of code into a comment, you can highlight it and use the shortcut cmd + /. The purpose of comments, is to either tell changes were made, show what was deleted, or to ask a question about a section of code. It is a direct way for two different collaborators to communicate and mark exactly where they were referring to.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
-  A Variable is like a storage container for a certain set of data we decide on. I would explain it as the variable is like the HotWheels garage, and the data is like the cars we put in the garage to keep them together.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?
- I often use Netflix, and I think one variable is when you enter your email and password, and that it is string data. I think another variable is when the time is counting on a show or movie along the bottom, and that it uses number data, and I think another variable is when you answer the question of whether or not you are still watching, boolean data is used there.

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
- Concatenation means joining different parts together. In regards to coding, it is joining different strings, numbers or booleans to make a new set of combined data.  

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation? I think when any website greets you by name after you log in (e.g. Hi Whitney, welcome back to instagram, we are happy to see you), that is a concatenation. Or anytime you unsubscribe it is the same idea of combining a set message with your information.

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option) I still have questions about the order of things, and pulling and pushing from GitHub. The command
git push origin main still confuses me. I feel like it needs more direction than that, like the name of a file or something. q
