## Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
- I noticed that both resources said mistakes are inevitable. For me this is easy to think about, but more difficult to deal with when the mistakes are actually happening. Another thing I appreciated from the video is the idea that the people she admires aren't just extremely smart and gifted people, but that they have worked really hard and experience has paid off. I think it is unfair to just assume anyone is naturally good at anything, because it really just minimizes all the work they put in. A third thing that resonated with me was the idea of making mental action notes. This is a great idea, and something that might really be helpful for me is not just a mental action plan, but actually writing it down.

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
- One thing I have really been improving on in the last few years is creating awareness of how I do/think about things. I used to get into a negative thought process and spiral ever deeper, but now I am much better at catching it, and not spiraling. One thing I have a difficult time with is seeing the mistakes as an opportunity for growth. I think with Turing I'm just so worried about getting behind, that I get so anxious about time. I need to remember the great resources Turing offers and make sure to utilize them!

3. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node and made some directions a bit more vague, intentionally. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?
- At first I found it frustrating, but it forced me to look up things I was uncertain about, and to use them in different ways, which helps me learn them better. It made me think outside of the copy/paste box, which forced me to type more and therefore learn more.

4. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.
- A conditional Statement means the second part of the code is dependent on the first part. IF the first condition is met, then the code executes a statement. However if that condition is not met, then either nothing happens, or something different is executed.
- An example of a real life conditional for me is if I don't take my vitamins, I will be really tired. If I do take my vitamins, I will not be near as tired.
- An example in a web application is any ad you click on and try to learn more, they will only give you the information if you give your email. If you don't give your email, you don't get any info.

5. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.
// One way to do it is to use logical operators. With the logical operator &&, both parts of the condition need to be true to have the condition go into affect. With the logical operator ||, as long as one part of the condition is true, the condition will go into affect.

6. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?
//The logical operators will be helpful for this. The && will make sure two conditions are met, while the || will make sure one of the two conditions are met.

---

7. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
//I had trouble with else if statements. On some, the code would not read them as one command, and I'm not sure why. Does it have to do with the setup of my original if statement? Also, outside of true and false, I do not understand how the logical operators work.
